# Lesson Plan

There are several "lesson plan" documents distributed across the notes. The information in this document is relevant to all lessons. Information relevant to say only Wordpress will be put in the Wordpress folder. If information is only relevant for a specific week then you will find it in the week's folder. If information is only relevant for a specific day then you will find it in the appropriate day folder. The idea is to only give you information that you need.

## Terminology

"Lesson" means a lecture or an activity that is directly supervised by the instructor. An "exercise" involves students doing some exploration. An "exercise" could be in the form of a "fake" client request or just a prompt/question that points students in the general direction they should be heading. Of course these types of lessons involve a bit of chaos and that's a good thing!
