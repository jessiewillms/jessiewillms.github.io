Is it from a survey (survey ‚Äì online survey vs. phone calls)?\n    \n    \n      How was the data verified? If data is entered by hand by a human person, how was it verified?\n    \n    \n      When was the data collected?\n    \n    \n      What is the gap between being collected and published? ie., there will always be a lag between when census data is collected from Canadians and when it is made available (to download/access)\n    \n  \n\n\nCheck for skewed data\n\n\n  Inflation\n  Currency inflation means that over time money changes in value\n  Check with the source of the data to see if the numbers are adjusted\n  How to correct Adjust the numbers for inflation (for example: using the Bank of Canada‚Äôs inflation calculator )\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Example\n      What does it look like\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Housing prices since the 1950s Wow! Homes got expensive! Adjusted for inflation, the 1950 home was $44,600. Still a big spike, but less drastic (and other factors, like the size of homes changing, can help explain this change).\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nmedian_housing_price.csv\n\n\n  Seasonal variation\n  Many types of data fluctuate naturally due to some underlying forces.\n    \n      for example: employment fluctuating with the seasons (ie., around the Christmas season, or summer months)\n      check if the data has been ‚Äúseasonally adjusted‚Äù\n    \n  \n  Timeframe or frame of reference has been manipulated\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Example\n      What does it look like\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      MTV‚Äôs Teen Mom vs. teen birth rate Teen Mom aired its first season in the summer of 2009.

Once you divide the dollars value by the shows_played_2101 value, it is clear that dollars refers to total earnings for the complete tour in 2018. The headers should be updated to reflect the content (the total per tour earning, and the per show earnings).\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nhighest_grossing_tours_2018.csv\n\nCheck for inconsistencies\n\n\n  Spelling is inconsistent\n    \n      Check that location/place names are consistent\n        \n          ie., Los Angelos instead of Los Angeles\n        \n      \n      Check locations for inconsistent spelling, or inconsistent short forms/abbreviations\n        \n          ie., both Sault Sainte.

If the data was collected in Canada, which format should be used?\n      \n    \n  \n\n\ndate_formats.csv\n\nCheck for numbers as text and text as numbers\n\n  Not all numerals are numbers\n  Spreadsheets programs often make the mistake of assuming numerals are numbers and stripping the leading zeros.\n    \n      ie., New England zip codes almost always start with zero, i.e. 02901\n      Excel assumes it‚Äôs numeric and ‚Äúhelpfully‚Äù drops that leading zero, making the value inaccurate\n    \n  \n  Good practice is to store numbers without formatting and to include supporting information in column names or metadata.\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Example\n      What does it look like\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Checking numberical values It looks like some of these number values are formatted incorrectly ‚Äî check that it is a formatting error (and not something else)\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nZeros replace missing values / data is missing\n\n  If you see zeros in a series of numbers you should ask yourself if those values are really the number 0 or if they instead mean \"nothing\". (-1 is also sometimes used this way.)\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Example\n      What does it look like\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Checking for zeros Did Bruno Mars really make millions of dollars playing a negative number of shows?\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nCheck number of columns and rows\n\n  Excel has (had) a maximum of 65,536 rows. If your dataset has 65,536 rows, you likely have a portion of the data. Go back to the source to confirm or request the full dataset.\n  Apple‚Äôs Numbers can only handle 255 columns. If 255 rows, you might only have a portion of the data. Go back to the source to confirm or request the full dataset.\n\n\nCheck for these suspicious values\nIf you see any of these values in your data, treat them with an abundance of caution:\n\nNumbers:\n\n\n  65,535\n  255\n  2,147,483,647\n  4,294,967,295\n  555-3485\n  99999 (or any other long sequence of 9‚Äôs)\n  00000 (or any other sequence of 0‚Äôs)\n\n\nDates:\n\n\n  1970-01-01T00:00:00Z\n  1969-12-31T23:59:59Z\n  January 1st, 1900\n  January 1st, 1904\n\n\nSpreadsheet has dates in 1900, 1904, 1969, or 1970\n\nExcel‚Äôs default date from which it counts all other dates is January 1st, 1900, unless you‚Äôre using Excel on a Mac, in which case it‚Äôs January 1st, 1904. There are a variety of ways in which data in Excel can be entered or calculated incorrectly and end up as one of these two dates. If you spot them in your data, it‚Äôs probably an issue.\n\nMany databases and applications will often generate a date of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z or 1969-12-31T23:59:59Z which is the Unix epoch for timestamps. In other words this is what happens when a system tries to display an empty value or a 0 value as a date.\n\nLocations:\n\n\n  0¬∞00'00.0\"N+0¬∞00'00.0\"E or simply 0¬∞N 0¬∞E\n  US zip code 12345 (Schenectady, New York)\n  US zip code 90210 (Beverly Hills, CA)\n\n\nEach of these numbers has an indication of a particular error made by either a human or a computer.

You will make mistakes and mess up a spreadsheet of information. You need to have a way to revert all your changes without affecting the integrity of the data.\n\nMake it clear ~in the name of the file~ that you are working with a copy of your data. For example: ufo-sightings-COPY.csv and ufo-sightings-ORIGINAL.csv\n\nAlso be sure to save the original data on a USB, Google Drive, external hard-drive.\n\nYour project folder should look something like this:\n\n\n  containing project folder (my_data_project)\n    \n      a COPY of the original dataset (ufos_BACKUP.csv or ufos_COPY.csv)\n      the Excel file with your analysis/changes (ufos.csv)\n      a text file that outlines your workflow/documents your dataset (README.md - or a data dictionary)\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nAdd permission settings\n\nAdd permissions/rules to the original so that only you can access it.\n\nIn Excel, you can add a password to a spreadsheet.\n\nIn Google Spreadsheets, you can add ‚Äúrules‚Äù to adjust settings by user.\n\nKeep notes about your workflow, etc.\n\nCreate a text document for future reference. Keep notes about when the spreadsheet was last updated/edited (this is especially important for ongoing work or collaborative work).\n\nFor example: if you create a column for the result of a function/calculation, make a note of the column, the calculation, and the expected result.\n\nRecord a reference of short-forms/codes, etc. you use.\n\nThe Pudding‚Äôs README.md for their piece ‚ÄúInternet Boy Band Database‚Äù\n\nName: Jessie Willms\nContact: jwillms@email.com\nDate: Jan. 14, 2019\n\nData: This spreadsheet contains UFO sightings that took place in Ontario in 2012.\nThe sightings were compiled from the website ufosightings.com.\nThe spreadsheet contains 101 rows and 17 columns.\n\nAnalysis: Created a Pivot Table to find the total number of \"red\" sightings that happened in the summer (May-August).\n\nProcess: I used this function to show sightings that were longer than 10 seconds: =IF(M4&gt;10,1,0).\n\nThe function executes in column H (long_sightings), with a value of 1 when true, and 0 when false.\n\n\n\nWhy do this\n\n\n  \n    Current you: writing out your process provides an opportunity to proofread/double check your work\n  \n  \n    Future you: you will likely forget exactly what you did; instead of guessing, you will have the steps you took, and know how to repeat it.\n  \n\n\nFor example: Your original reporting about bicycle thefts in Toronto includes data for 2010 to 2017. In January 2019, Toronto Police release data for 2018. You should be able to repeat your initial analysis in January 2019. Ensure you have sufficient notes to make this possible.\n\n\n\n  In addition:\n  Someone else (a data editor) can check your work\n  Another data reporter should be able to reproduce your results\n  Use this information to share your methodology/process with experts/readers\n\n\n\n",

        "title": "Working with VLOOKUP ‚Äî SOLUTION",
        "content": "## SOLUTION\n\n- **Question** Which of the highest grossing touring artists from 2018 **also** made the list of highest attendance at a show?\n- **Answer** U2, ...\n\n### Step 1: Find and import the data.\n\n**Step A.** Copy and paste the Billboard data. Split on the semi-colon. Correct the Shania Twain value. Rename tab to `2018_tours`.\n\n![Import data 1](vlookup_solution/step-1-copy-data.gif)\n\n**Step 2.** Use the `IMPORTHTML` function to pull in table data from Wikipedia (it is the second table on the page). The function should look like this:\n\n`=IMPORTHTML(\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-attended_concerts\", \"table\", 2)`\n\n![Use IMPORTHTML to get table](vlookup_solution/step-1-get-table.gif)\n\n**Step B.** When you use the the IMPORTHTML function, you are opening a connection between your spreadsheet and the website where the data table is live on the internet. In order to work with the data, you must remove that connection.\n\nOption 1: Copy + paste special (being on the lookout for date formatting errors).\n\n_Option 2:_ Download the data as a CSV and re-import the data. The advantage of this option is it is 1. usually pretty fast, and 2. is less likely to encourage errors in the data (specifically date formats).\n\n![highest attended concerts](vlookup_solution/step-1-replace-data.gif)\n\nNow we are able to sort, filter, and otherwise _use_ the data.\n\n**Step C.** Correct the `Attendance` column.\n\nWe can now use the built-in `split text to columns` function to correct the Attendance column. Note: When using this function, whatever content is _to the right of your splitting character_ will be returned in the next column.\n\nIn our example: the data we want is in column F (Attendance), and the references/citations are in the next column (G). For this example, it's okay column G will be overwritten since we don't need the citations.\n\nWe will use the `‚ô†` character to split this column. The we will rename the column, and delete unnecessary data.\n\n![split highest attended concerts](vlookup_solution/step-3-split-column.gif)\n\n### Step 2: Check the data.\n\nFirst, you should notice in your data about highest attended concerts is missing some data. Before working with this sheet, be sure to correct empty cells.\n\nThis is a good use case for two things:\n\nTip 1. Create a new column and populate it with a counter. This will allow us to put the data back in its original order after we sort and filter the sheet.\n\nAfter the counter is created, we can sort a column (Z-A) to find empty cells.\n\n![counter + sort to find empty cells](vlookup_solution/counter-sort-empty-cells.gif)\n\nTip 2. Using conditional formatting to highlight empty cells.\n\nOnce you identify the missing cells, populate the missing information. In this case, Oasis and Robbie Williams performed back-to-back dates at the same venue. We can copy/paste the missing values.\n\nAlso be sure to replace the `‚Ä¢` character (Edit > Find + replace). On Wikipedia, this character indicated the concert was the highest-attended of all time up to that point.\n\n![conditional formmating](vlookup_solution/conditional-formatting.gif)\n\n\n\nIn order to use VLOOKUP, we need the fist column (column A) in both sheets to contain the same variable. In our example, we need artist names in the first column. Drag the columns to reorder.\n\n![reorder](vlookup_solution/reorder.gif)\n\n### Step 3: Data work\n\nCreate a dropdown menu that lists the artists from the highest grossing tour list.\n\n![data validation to make list](vlookup_solution/data-validation-make-list.gif)\n\nThen write a VLOOKUP function that looks for a match to the value (artist) in B2 (our dropdown menu of artist names).\n\nThis is what the function will look like:\n\n```\n=VLOOKUP(B2, highest_attended_concerts!A2:G25, 1, false)\n```\n\nVLOOKUP is a function that takes three parameters (or arguments).\n\nThe first parameter, `B2`: This the reference to the value we are looking for. In our example, we created a dropdown menu so we can easily look for a match without typing each artist's name. `B2` is a reference to a string value.\n\nThe second parameter, `highest_attended_concerts!A2:G25`: This is where we are looking for the artist (referenced in `B2`). In this example, we are looking in a sheet called `highest_attended_concerts`. We are then looking in a range of values, starting at `A2` and ending at `G25`. These two values are separated by an exclamation mark (`!`).\n\nThe second parameter, `1`: This is the index. When VLOOKUP returns a match, this is the column index of the value to be returned. So, if we want to return the name of the artist (the match), we use `1` because in `highest_attended_concerts` the artist name is the first column.\n\nTo return the number of people who attended that show, we would use an index of 7, for column G (attendance). üîó[Screenshot](https://cl.ly/36b29e53aed0/annotate)\n\n![VLOOKUP](vlookup_solution/writing-the-vlookup-function.gif)\n\nWe can look through the options in the dropdown for matches. __U2__, for example, had a highest attended show, and a highest grossing 2018 tour.\n\nHowever, while __Ed Sheeran__ made $429,491,502 touring in 2018, he does not have a \"highest attended\" show. His name returns an `N/A` error.\n\n![no match](vlookup_solution/no-match.png)\n\nWhile this `N/A` error is fine, we can wrap our function to produce a nicer, cleaner result.\n\nWe can wrap the lookup function in another function that checks for errors and returns a boolean value.\n\nThis is what the function will look like:\n\n```\n=ISNA( VLOOKUP(B2, highest_attended_concerts!A2:G25, 1, false)\n```\n\nWhen there is an error, this function will evaluate TRUE. Otherwise, it will return FALSE.\n\n![ISNA](vlookup_solution/isna.gif)\n\nWe can now wrap our error handling function in another function. We can use the `IF` to return the name of the artist if they are on the attendance list, and return a string of text otherwise.\n\nThis is what the function will look like:\n\n```\n=IF( ISNA( VLOOKUP(B2, highest_attended_concerts!A2:G25, 1, false)), \"Not on the list.\", B2)\n```\n\n![IF](vlookup_solution/isna.gif)\n\nWe can continue to wrap and build out this function to return other values from the same row.\n\nFor example, we can check that are artist is on the highest attended concerts list, then return the date of the show, the city, and how many tickets were sold.\n\nThis is what the function will look like:\n\n```\n=IF( ISNA( VLOOKUP(B2, highest_attended_concerts!A2:G25, 1, false)), \"NOT on the list\", VLOOKUP(B2, highest_attended_concerts!A2:G25, 3, false))\n```\n\n![Many function many retunrs](vlookup_solution/many-functions-many-returns.png)\n\n### Next steps\n\nWhat happens when there is more than one match? _For example, U2 is on the highest attended concerts list more than once._\n\n\n#### More on VLOOKUP\n[More than one match](https://www.ablebits.com/office-addins-blog/2017/02/22/vlookup-multiple-values-excel/)\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "## Using `VLOOKUP` to answer the question:\n\n- Which of the highest grossing touring artists from 2018 **also** made the list of highest attendance at a show?\n\n### Step 1: Find and import the data.\n\n**Billboard:** [Highest grossing 2018 tours](https://www.billboard.com/articles/events/year-in-music-2018/8488851/touring-charts-year-ed-sheeran-tops-taylor-swift-beyonce)\n**Wikipedia:** [List of highest-attended concerts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-attended_concerts)\n\nIn a tab/sheet called `2018_tours`: Copy and paste the `2018 TOP 25 TOURS` data into a Google Spreadsheet. Use the `split text to columns` function to convert this CSV-ish data into a well-structured table.\n\n![Split to columns](../img/vlookup-1.gif)\n\nIn a tab/sheet called `highest_attended_concerts`: Use the `IMPORTHTML` function to import the table of highest-attended concerts from Wikipedia. (You will need the `split text to columns` to correct the formatting on the `Attendance` column.)\n\n![IMPORTHTML](../img/vlookup-2.gif)\n\n### Step 2: Check the data.\n\n**This is important:** In order to use the `VLOOKUP` function, the fist column of data (`column A`) in ~both~ sheets needs to contain the same variable (ie., the artist name). This value is our üîë (our unique identifier, our ID).\n\nIn a tab/sheet called `2018_tours`: move the `Rank` column one to the right. (So the artist names, our key, is in the first column).\n\nWe can also re-name the column headers for the `artist/act` columns so that variable is consistent in both tabs. We can use `artist`.\n\n![Rename columns](../img/vlookup-3.gif)\n\n### Step 3: Data work\n\nIn a new tab (call it `data_work` or something similar): Use `data validation` to create a dropdown menu that lists the artists from the highest grossing tour list (tab/sheet name: `2018_tours`).\n\n* In cell `B2`\n* Open the data validation modal: Go `Data > Data validation`\n* Under `Criteria` > select `List from a range` > then select the column of artist names `2018_tours!A2:A100`\n* This will create a dropdown list in the cell.\n\n![Split to columns](../img/vlookup-4.gif)\n\nIn `data_work`: write the `VLOOKUP` function to compare the value of `B2` with the value of any cell in `column A `in `highest_attended_concerts`.\n\n* In cell `B3`\n* Write the `VLOOKUP` function:\n\n```\n=VLOOKUP(search_key, range, index, true_false)\n```\n\n**search_key**: what we want to look for: a value, or a reference to a value.\n    - `B2` (the cell with the dropdown menu)\n\n**range**: where we are looking for the value\n    - `highest_attended_concerts!A1:E100`\n    - the sheet (`highest_attended_concerts`), `!`, and the range (`!A1:E100`)\n    - always select the full range of data\n    - we are selecting from the first cell in the top right to beyond the last cell of data in the last column - `E100`\n\n**index**: which column to return\n    - `1`: the first column (the name of the artist)\n    - `5`: the attendance at that show\n\n**true_false**: true/false if the data is sorted\n    - `false`\n\n...all together:\n\n```\n=VLOOKUP(B2, highest_attended_concerts!A1:E25, 1, false)\n```\n\nIf you see `#N/A`, the lookup function did not return a match. When you see an artist name, that is the match.\n\n![Split to columns](../img/vlookup-5.png)\n\nWe can update the `index` value to return the name of the tour, the number of people in attendance, or any other value from the attendance list. (Hint: when looking for a match, start with some of the ~older~ artists. You should find two matches.)\n\nWe can wrap the lookup function in another function, to return the name of the artist if they are on the attendance list (`TRUE`), and return a string of text otherwise (`FALSE`).\n\n```\n=IF( ISNA(VLOOKUP(B3, highest_attended_concerts!A1:B100, 1, false)), \"Not on the attendance list\", B3 )\n```\n\n`ISNA`: Checks whether a value is the error `#N/A`.\n\n`ISNA(A2)`\n\n`IF`: Checks against a true/false statement, returns 1 or 0\n\n`IF(logical_expression, value_if_true, value_if_false)`\n\n\n\n\n| Review: what we covered |   |\n| :------------- | :------------- |\n| Split text to columns       | ‚úÖ       |\n| IMPORTHTML function       | ‚úÖ       |\n| Paste special       | ‚úÖ       |\n| Data validation: create a dropdown list        | ‚úÖ       |\n| VLOOKUP function        | ‚úÖ       |\n| Bonus: VLOOKUP function wrapped in an IF function        | ‚úÖ       |\n\n#### More on VLOOKUP\n[VLOOKUP](https://exceljet.net/excel-functions/excel-vlookup-function)\n[YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7gQ-PgYkMc)\n[VLOOKUP at Starbucks](http://www.excelcampus.com/functions/excel-vlookup-explained/)\n[Google support for VLOOKUP](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093318?hl=en)\n[ISNA](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093293?hl=en)\n[IF](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093364)\n\n\n",
