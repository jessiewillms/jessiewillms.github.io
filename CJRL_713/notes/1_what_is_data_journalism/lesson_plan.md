# Lesson Plan

## Type 1: Lesson

There are two possible ways of tackling the **lessons**.

1. Teacher led instruction
2. Student led instruction

In the first option, a teacher is on the stage explaining/presenting with punctuated interruptions for doing problem sets. This option should be chosen by default. The second option should be chosen if a decent chunk of the students are already very familiar with the content.

### Why?

* lecture might frustrate students who know the material really well
* teaching is a great way to learn subtle concepts so students should get this opportunity
* students will get a chance to form bonds/friendships early


### Student led instruction

* form groups of 2-3 students
* each group should have one student comfortable teaching
* groups go through the notes/problems with one student playing the role of teacher
* instructors circulate to answer questions


## Type 2: Exercise

This is a flipped version of a regular lesson. Instead of having notes to go through, students are given prompts/questions to guide their exploration. Students should work in groups to answer the questions.

Give students about 2/3 of the allotted time to work. In the last 1/3 portion, get everyone together to discuss their findings.

* Groups should present their findings and collaboratively form a class set of notes.
* If notes are available (some days they are) then briefly go through them to make sure that all topics were covered.
* Some students will have stumbled on some interesting topics; discuss them if there is time or make a note of them for a future lesson.

Some students will struggle in this environment. Talk to them to address their issues right away. The students need to be really comfortable doing exploration and research otherwise they will not survive as freelancers.
